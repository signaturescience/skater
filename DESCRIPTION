Title: Utilities for SNP-Based Kinship Analysis
Description: Utilities for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based kinship analysis
    testing and evaluation. The 'skater' package contains functions for importing, parsing, 
    and analyzing pedigree data, performing relationship degree inference, benchmarking 
    relationship degree classification, and summarizing identity by descent (IBD) segment data.
    Package functions and methods are described in Turner et al. (2021) "skater: An R package 
    for SNP-based Kinship Analysis, Testing, and Evaluation" <doi:10.1101/2021.07.21.453083>.
